dotlauncher is a game inspired by Space Invaders. It was made for me to learn Lua, Love2D and what it's like to actually develop a game from scratch.

Currently, dotlauncher is in a very early alpha phase. I intend for the final version to have:
- Multiple waves
- Shooting Enemies
- Multiplayer (in another version of it)
- Good graphics
- And more!
Refer to the todo list below for everything I want to add.

# Todo
Since the game is very early in it's stage of life, I still have a lot to work on. Here is a full todo list of what I want the entire game to have:
- Multiple waves
- Shooting Enemies
- Multiplayer (in another version of it)
- Graphics **WIP**
- Sound
- Better collision detection
- Minigames..?
- ~~Main Menu~~ **DONE**
- Settings
- More keyboard shortcuts/controls
- More efficient code
