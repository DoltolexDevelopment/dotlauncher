    dotlauncher is a game inspired by Space Invaders. It is not made to recreate but simulate an experience similar to it.
    It was made for me (SamuraiStacks) to learn Lua, Love2D and what it's like to actually develop a game from scratch.

        These right here are just some images that we will load to use in our game.
        Instead of making stuff from rectangles and other shapes, we can use assets made in a app specifically for creating pixel art.
        Not everything will be pictures though, as the bullet can still be generated.

        So, to make a main menu we will have to have a different "state" for the game.
        My plan is to make it so there are 3 types of states:
        i. Game state
        ii. Main menu state
        iii. Pause menu state

        All this variable does is make it so we can know what state the game is currently in.
